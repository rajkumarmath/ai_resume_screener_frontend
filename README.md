# 🚀 AI Resume Screener SaaS - Frontend

A production-grade, Next.js 14 frontend for an AI-powered Resume Matching SaaS platform. This application allows recruiters and hiring managers to create job postings, upload applicant resumes, and use AI to automatically score and explain the match percentage between a candidate and a job.

## 💡 What It Does & How It Works

Traditional recruitment involves manually reading hundreds of resumes to find candidates who match a specific job description. The **AI Resume Screener** automates this process using artificial intelligence, turning hours of manual screening into a few seconds of computation.

Here is the core workflow a recruiter or hiring manager takes within the app:

1. **Create a Job Context:** The user navigates to the **Jobs** dashboard and creates a new job posting. They define the Title, a detailed Description, and a list of mandatory Skills (e.g., `React, TypeScript, FastAPI`).
2. **Upload Applicant Data:** In the **Resumes** dashboard, the user uploads PDF or Word document resumes received from applicants, tagging them with the candidate's name.
3. **Run the AI Matcher:** On the **AI Match** page, the user selects a specific Job from a dropdown menu and hits "Run Match". 
4. **Actionable Insights:** The backend AI processes the text of the resumes against the context of the job description. The frontend then dynamically renders the results:
   * **Percentage Scores:** Candidates are ranked from highest to lowest match, visualized with animated progress bars.
   * **Smart Categorization:** Scores are color-coded into visual badges (`Top Match` for >80%, `Medium` for 50-79%, and `Low` for <50%).
   * **AI Explanations:** Instead of just giving a blind score, the app displays a human-readable explanation generated by the AI detailing *why* the candidate is a good fit (e.g., "The candidate has 3 years of React experience but lacks FastAPI").


## ✨ Features

- **🔐 Secure Authentication:** JWT-based user registration and login using FastAPI's standard OAuth2 workflow.
- **🛡️ Protected Routes:** Context API seamlessly handles authentication state and protects dashboard routes from unauthorized access.
- **📄 Resume Management:** Upload resumes (`.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`) securely via `multipart/form-data`.
- **💼 Job Board Creation:** Create, view, and manage job postings with specific required skills.
- **🤖 AI Match Engine:** Run an AI algorithm to match resumes against specific jobs, complete with visual progress bars (0-100%) and AI-generated reasoning/explanations.
- **🎨 Modern UI/UX:** Built with Tailwind CSS, featuring responsive design, interactive hover states, animated progress bars, and clean layout patterns.

🚀 Getting Started (Local Development)
1. Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or higher)

npm or yarn

A running instance of the FastAPI backend.

2. Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
git clone [https://github.com/rajkumarmath/ai_resume_screener_frontend.git](https://github.com/rajkumarmath/ai_resume_screener_frontend.git)
cd ai-resume-screener-frontend
npm install

. Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file in the root of your project and add your FastAPI backend URL:

Code snippet
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=[https://ai-resume-screener-gr9g.onrender.com](https://ai-resume-screener-gr9g.onrender.com)
4. Run the Development Server
Start the Next.js development server:

Bash
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.

📡 API Integration Details
This frontend strictly adheres to the provided backend OpenAPI contracts. Notable integrations include:

OAuth2 Login: Handles application/x-www-form-urlencoded payload mapping email to the required username field.

Interceptors: Automatically attaches Authorization: Bearer <token> to all outgoing requests and redirects to /login if a 401 Unauthorized response is intercepted.

Error Handling: Gracefully catches FastAPI 422 Validation Error arrays and extracts the readable .msg string for UI display.

☁️ Deployment
This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel.

Push your code to GitHub.

Import the repository into Vercel.

Add the NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL environment variable in the Vercel project settings.

Click Deploy.

(Note: Custom ESLint and TypeScript build-time errors have been configured to allow smooth deployments via next.config.mjs if necessary).

Built with ❤️ for the future of AI recruitment.
